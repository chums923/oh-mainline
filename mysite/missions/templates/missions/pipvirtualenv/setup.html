    <h3>Setup pip and virtualenv</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    <p>We are going to use a shell script(for Linux) and a Mac application
    which will automatically download and install pip and virtualenv on our
    system. The shell script and the Mac application are part of a project
    called <a href="http://pip2014.com/">pip2014</a>, a project by 
    <a href="https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/">Glyph</a>.</p>

    <h3>Linux</h3>

    <p>Open up the terminal, type the following command and press Enter:</p>
    <pre>curl https://glyph.im/pip/bootstrap.sh | bash</pre>

    <p>Some Python packages that have C extensions also require a C compiler
    so that the C extensions can be compiled. A good example of a package
    that has such requirements is <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a>,
    a package for scientific computing with Python.</p>

    <p>To install a C compiler on Debian or Ubuntu, at the terminal,
    type the following command and press Enter:</p>
    <pre>sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev</pre>

    <p>To install a C compiler on Fedora, at the terminal, type the
    following command and press Enter:</p>
    <pre>sudo yum install python-devel</pre>

    <h3>Running into problems</h3>

    <p>Once the shell script/Mac application has finished running, it will
    output the following:</p>
    <samp>Start a new terminal now to use pip, or hit enter to keep using this
    one. (Pip won't work yet in this one, though.)</samp>
    <p>After you press Enter and restart the terminal, pip as well as the other
    tools that were installed should work. However, on some Linux distributions, 
    when you try and run pip(for instance, by typing <kbd>pip</kbd> at the
    command-line) after restarting the terminal, the shell replies with
    <q>command not found</q> or something similar.</p>

    <p>If this is the case, the following commands should fix it:</p>
    <pre>echo source "${HOME}/.pip_bootstrap_profile.sh" >> ~/.bashrc</pre>
    <pre>source ~/.bashrc</pre>

    <h3>Mac OS X</h3>
    <p>Before you can work with pip and virtualenvs, you'll need to check if
    Python is installed on your machine; checking for Python on your computer
    is as simple as opening up the Terminal application and typing <q>python</q>
    and pressing Enter. If you're greeted with a Python prompt (which looks like
    <q>>>></q>), you're good to go; instead if you get an error, we recommend going
    through the <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/">
    Installing Python on Mac OS X</a> section of the <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/">
    The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python!</a></p>
